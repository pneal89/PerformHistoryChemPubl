# Performance History Chemistry Database

This project is for The University of Memphis chemistry department. The department in the past has been using excel spread sheets to manage the attempts that student take for each class. This project solves this problem and allows the chemistry department to have a database of student and course information. This allows the administrators of the department to view data and import csv of data each semester and view reports of the data.

Basic useful feature list:

 * Import students
 * Import courses
 * Import Grades
 * Notify students of third class attempt
